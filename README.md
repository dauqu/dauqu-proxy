# Dauqu Proxy

A reverse proxy is a type of server that sits in front of an application or group of applications and directs incoming traffic to the appropriate backend server. In Golang, you can create a reverse proxy by using the http package to handle incoming requests and forwarding them to the appropriate backend server. This can be useful for load balancing, SSL termination, and other common reverse proxy tasks. When describing your reverse proxy on GitHub, it may be helpful to include information such as the specific features and capabilities of the proxy, any dependencies that are required, and instructions for how to set up and use the proxy in a production environment.
